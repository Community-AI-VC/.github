# AI VC

## Hi there 👋

Some of us may have pitched to VCs 🙋‍♀️

Some of us may have received funding from VCs 🙋‍♀️

Some of us may be VCs themselves (or angel investors) 🙋‍♀️

Some may not be any of the above 🙋‍♀️

Regardless, we're all united in our curiosity to see how the new AI (mostly LLM based) can contribute to the process of making VC funding process better for founders and investors alike.
