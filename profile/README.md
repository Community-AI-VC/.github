# AI VC

## Hi there 👋

The idea with the AI VC is to create a crowd-fund via DAO that tokenizes shares in startups whose pitch decks pass the AI and the human investors (with AI ultinately deciding on funding decision.)

The reason is because like most of you I have 1001 ideas, and like a few of you 15+ yrs of coding experience, and there was never a time like this when all those 1001 can be built and launched in a single year. Thanks to ChatGPT.

So with the influx of thousands of ideas from each person now that ChatGPT is liberating people to build their ideas on their own, in their spare time, we will need a more scalable process to evaluate and fund all these ideas.

Whether you like the idea or not, I'm proceeding with building the tools to enable it. You're opinion is important, but not something that would change my mind. 

I've made a vision-model + llm AI that beats the crap out of OpenAI's latest greatest Code Interpreter in both the correctness and completeness of extract data and the generalized/universal ability to reason about that data. Very few understand how hard it is to interpret unstructured visual data of arbitrary layout/format. Solving that problem solves it for many other fields where this technology is needed.
