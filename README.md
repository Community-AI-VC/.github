# Community AI VC

Some of us may have pitched to VCs.

Some of us may have received funding from VCs.

Some of us may be VCs themselves (or angel investors.)

Some may not be any of the above.

Regardless, we're all united in our curiosity to see how the new AI (mostly LLM based) can contribute to the process of making VC funding transparent, data-driven and equitable.

We are simply driven to see what's possible.

## Simply stated:

\#ai + \#dao + \#vc = ??
